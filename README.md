Charles Schwab Interview
The instructions for the challenge are below:

You’ll have 24hrs to complete this coding challenge. It's important to note that it's by no means a test...we just want to get a sense for how you write code and solve problems.

Leveraging the Wikipedia API, we’d like you to use HTML, CSS and Javascript to read the API and display it in an organized way. In addition, you should add in some sort of sorting mechanic to the front-end. Please be sure to use Bootstrap as the framework of choice for building out the front end components AND be sure to make it responsive.

Sample Query (Straight from Wikipedia Site) (You can be as creative as you’d like with the pulling of queries. A search of Wikipedia would be great!):
